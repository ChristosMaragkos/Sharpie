# Sharpie Console v0.1 (Alpha)

Thank you for downloading the Sharpie fantasy console! No, seriously, your support means everything.
The program you have downloaded is a *runner* for the Sharpie console, specifically built on Raylib and tested extensively. It allows up to two players and has full controller support.

## Getting Started

1. **Windows:** Run `Sharpie.exe`.
2. **Linux:** Run `./Sharpie` (maybe you will need to `chmod +x` it), or fill in the paths of the included `.desktop` file and run that.
3. **MacOS:** MacOS is currently not supported, but it might be in the future. Stick around!

All necessary assets are included either in the `zip` you just downloaded or embedded into the executable itself, so no need to worry about dependencies!

## Controls (Keyboard/Joypad)
Currently, the keyboard controls Player 1, and the first detected controller controls Player 2, with the second one going to Player 1 as well. The control scheme is as follows:

- **D-pad:** Arrow Keys / Left Joystick or controller d-pad if you like to live on the edge
- **A:** Z / XBox B or PlayStation circle or Nintendo A
- **B:** X / XBox A or PlayStation X or Nintendo B
- **Start:** Left Shift / The right middle button (PlayStation Start, Switch Pro Controller +)
- **Option:** Tab / The left middle button
- **Reset:** Currently no reset button.

## Loading ROMs
To load a ROM, you can either start the Sharpie by dragging the `.shr` file on it or start the program and then drag the ROM in. However, to load another cartridge, you must restart the console.

Since this is a 0.1 release, there are not many ROMs, but a few example ones showcasing the Sharpie's capability exist in the `samples` directory in GitHub, and there will be more over time that you will be able to download, either in assembly form to study for yourself or (soon) in binary form to run.

## Support
If you encounter any issues with the Runner or the SDK or have any suggestions, please open an issue over at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristosMaragkos/Sharpie).

Happy playing and developing!
